A simple FlickrFeed Viewer

Basic FlickrFeed Viewer using BackboneJS. My first go at using BackboneJS.

To run locally, you will require the following globally:
* Grunt
* nightwatch

To get running:
1. Clone repo
2. npm install
3. run `grunt dev`

Grunt Dev - will run a local development server and watch the Sass and JS file, and place them in the app/a folder


## Testing

Initial testing is located in the tests folder, at the moment just a basic test to check inital page is rendering.
